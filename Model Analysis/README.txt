This folder contains the MATLAB code to replicate the modeling analysis in the paper.
The function "Solve_Dynamic_Problem", solves the stationary model and the different dynamic paths. It calls the other auxiliary functions in that process.
"Plots_Final" generates some of the figures used in the briefing note.

	
Please note:
	1. The code includes two functions that were written by contributors to the mathworks community: i) wprctile and ii) gini.
	   We include these codes in line with the their usage policies, including the copyright notice and any further disclaimer 
	   with the function. We are grateful to the authors for providing us with their work.
	2. In all cases, the first period refers to the stationary equilibrium pre-COVID19.
